# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Xin Zheng**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Weather App** is an android app that **displays current weather information for any city in the world using the Open-Meteo API. Users can search for cities and view temperature, wind speed, and weather conditions with icons.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üå§Ô∏è üåç üîç**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **city name (using Open-Meteo Geocoding API to convert city names to latitude/longitude coordinates)**
- [x] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Added weather icons that change based on weather conditions
- [x] Implemented city search functionality to check weather worldwide
- [x] Used Glide library for efficient image loading
- [x] Added Toast messages for user feedback on search errors
- [x] Default location set to Philadelphia, PA

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **Open-Meteo Weather API** (https://open-meteo.com/).

I also used the **Open-Meteo Geocoding API** (https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/) to convert city names to geographic coordinates.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

### What I Learned:
- How to make HTTP requests using AsyncHTTPClient in Android
- Working with JSON responses and parsing weather data
- Implementing the Glide library for loading images from URLs
- Using multiple APIs together (Weather API + Geocoding API)
- Handling user input validation and error cases
- The importance of adding Internet permissions in AndroidManifest.xml

### Challenges:
- Initially forgot to add Internet permission, which caused "Failed to load weather" errors
- Had to figure out how to convert city names to coordinates using a geocoding API
- Learning how to properly parse JSON responses with nested objects

### Future Improvements:
- Add a 7-day forecast feature
- Display more weather details (humidity, precipitation, UV index)
- Save favorite cities
- Add background images that change based on weather conditions
- Implement current location detection using GPS
